# Web Page Design - Spring 2018

## Lab-4 - Creating Tables and External Style Sheets

**Discussion:** In Chapter 4, you will practice with external style sheets, links, and tables.

1. Complete the chapter tutorial on pages 155-208.
1. Complete Lab 2 on page 214.
1. Complete **Cases and Places** project 2. Your task is to create a web page with a schedule. You can have as much leeway as you wish and do not have to adhere to the scenario in the text. But the subject that you choose to use should be somewhat believable and should use an external style sheet to format it. You do not have to submit a sketch of the web page.

When you are finished, push the entire repository back to github.
